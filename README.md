ðŸ“ˆ Stock Market Prediction System
This project involves building a machine learning application to predict stock prices based on historical data and time series analysis, helping investors and analysts make informed decisions.

ðŸ”§ Key Features:
Data Collection & Preprocessing:

Collected historical stock price data including open, high, low, close prices, and trading volume.

Cleaned and transformed data by handling missing values, normalizing features, and creating lagged variables to capture temporal dependencies.

Feature Engineering:

Generated technical indicators such as moving averages and rolling statistics to enhance model predictive power.

Created date-based features to account for seasonality and trends in the data.

Model Training & Evaluation:

Implemented and compared multiple machine learning algorithms:

Linear Regression for establishing a baseline.

Random Forest Regressor to model non-linear relationships.

XGBoost Regressor for high-performance prediction.

Evaluated models using metrics like RMSE and RÂ² score to ensure robust forecasting.

Visualization:

Created visual plots to compare actual vs. predicted stock prices over time.

Included feature importance charts to interpret model decisions.

Prediction Interface:

Developed a user-friendly interface where users can input or select stock symbols and view forecasted prices.

Deployment:

Packaged the workflow into an interactive application for easy use and demonstration.

ðŸ§  Technologies Used:
Python

Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn

XGBoost

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Jupyter Notebook

This project demonstrates how machine learning and data analysis can be applied to time series forecasting for financial applications, providing valuable insights into stock price trends and patterns.
