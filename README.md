Stock Market Prediction is an end-to-end machine learning project designed to forecast future stock prices using deep learning techniques. The system retrieves historical stock data via APIs, preprocesses and enriches it with technical indicators like moving averages and Fibonacci retracement levels, and trains an LSTM neural network built with TensorFlow and Keras to model complex time-series trends. An interactive web interface developed in Streamlit enables users to input stock tickers, generate predictions, and visualize results through dynamic charts and indicator plots. To provide comprehensive market insights, the app also integrates live news headlines relevant to each stock. The project demonstrates advanced skills in data engineering, deep learning, and intuitive user experience design, offering a practical tool for exploring financial forecasting.
